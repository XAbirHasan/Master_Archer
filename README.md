# Master_Archer
This game is made for my university project. This project was selected by my lecturer. That time I had no idea how to deal with animation and handle object motion. But after trying I have got this. And this is the best project chosen by my lecturer. And also he gave me 10 extra marks. I got a total of 50/40 XD.
